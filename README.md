A zip file containing two rdata files, one each for TripAdvisor and Yelp Restaurant reviews from local and non-local users.

TripAdvisor: ~100k reviews
Yelp: ~250k reviews

There is a field for each review that indicates whether we thought they were local or non-local, but the original coordinates are still there so that you can decide for yourself.

Have fun :)
